# PCBulacan AI Chat Support - Recent Updates

## Date: October 27, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Chat Widget Size Reduction ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Chat widget was too large and overlapping with content

**Solution:**
- Reduced width from 380px to **340px**
- Reduced height from 520px to **480px**
- Added `max-height: calc(100vh - 8rem)` to prevent overflow
- Mobile: Full screen with `max-height: 100vh`
- Chat bubble: Reduced from 60px to **55px** on mobile

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/support.html` - CSS for `.chat-widget`

---

### 2. Improved Shipping Query Matching ‚úÖ
**Issue:** AI couldn't answer "how much shipping fee in pandi" or "magkano shipping sa pandi bulacan"

**Solution:**
- Implemented **scoring system** for location matching:
  - Score 3: Both city AND state in message (best match)
  - Score 2: City only in message
  - Score 1: State only in message
- Now handles queries like:
  - "shipping pandi" ‚Üí Finds Pandi, Bulacan
  - "magkano pandi bulacan" ‚Üí Finds Pandi, Bulacan
  - "delivery fee bulacan" ‚Üí Finds any Bulacan city
- Added keyword "tagal" for delivery time queries

**Files Modified:**
- `products/views.py` - `parse_and_respond()` function
- Updated to use correct field names: `fee_amount`, `estimated_days`, `is_available`

---

### 3. Removed "Submit Ticket" References ‚úÖ
**Issue:** User requested removal of ticket submission feature

**Solution:**
- Removed "Submit Ticket" quick link from hero section
- Updated hero subtitle from:
  - OLD: "Get instant answers, submit tickets, or chat with our AI assistant"
  - NEW: "Get instant answers from FAQs or chat with our AI assistant"
- Removed entire ticket form section (already done earlier)

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/support.html` - Hero section quick links

---

### 4. Added Delivery Fee Data ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No delivery fees in database, AI couldn't answer shipping queries

- Meycauayan: ‚Ç±120.00 (3-5 days)

## Known Limitations

1. **Keyword Matching Only**
   - Uses simple keyword matching, not advanced NLP
   - May not understand complex phrasing

2. **Single Query Per Message**
   - Can't handle multiple questions in one message
   - Example: "magkano shipping AND warranty?" ‚Üí Only answers one

3. **No Context Memory**
   - Each message is independent
   - Can't refer to previous messages

4. **Limited to Database Data**
   - Can only answer about existing orders, products, fees
   - Can't handle hypothetical questions

---

## Error Handling

### If Chat Doesn't Work
1. **Check Server:** Ensure Django server is running
2. **Check Console:** Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
3. **Check API:** Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/chat/ (should show 405 Method Not Allowed)
4. **Check Database:** Run `python manage.py shell` and query `DeliveryFee.objects.all()`

### If Location Not Found
- Add the city to database using `add_delivery_fees.py`
- Or manually via Django admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
